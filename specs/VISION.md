# SheepDoggo: Product Vision

**Platform**: SheepDoggo
**Tagline**: _Your AI pastoral co-pilot_
**Core Purpose**: Synthesizes every signal a ministry generates — attendance, texts, prayers, devotionals, groups — into actionable pastoral intelligence
**Business Model**: SaaS subscription for churches and youth ministries
**Onboarding**: White-glove setup (team creates org, invites customer as owner)

> _"The tool should never feel stale. It should feel fun. Useful. Enjoyable to use. Easy. Quite literally divinely inspired."_

## The Problem

A youth pastor has 100 students. They know who showed up on Wednesday — maybe. They know who texted back — if they scroll their phone. They know who prayed at small group — if the group leader mentioned it. They know who opened the devotional — if they remember to check.

None of this talks to each other.

**The winter camp example:**

> "I need to message 30 students who came last week — a quick broadcast works. Another 30 are semi-active and could get that same invite with a warm personal touch. But the remaining 40? They need personalized outreach, because I haven't seen some of them in months. Today I do this segmentation in my head. It takes hours. People fall through the cracks. Every single week."

Current tools don't solve this. Planning Center, Rock RMS, and CCB are **record-keeping systems**. They store data. They tell you who came. They don't tell you who _needs_ you.

The pastor's real question is never "what's my attendance trend?" It's: **"Who should I reach out to today, and what should I say?"**

No tool on the market answers that question. SheepDoggo does.

## What SheepDoggo Is

SheepDoggo is the first AI pastoral co-pilot. Not a check-in app. Not a CRM. Not a dashboard. A **co-pilot**.

Three things a co-pilot does that a database never will:

### 1. Synthesizes

Connects attendance patterns to prayer requests to text conversations to devotional engagement to group participation. No pastor can hold all these signals in their head for 100 students. The co-pilot can.

### 2. Anticipates

Surfaces who needs you _before_ you have to ask. A student who broke their check-in streak, stopped replying to texts, _and_ submitted a heavy prayer request last week — that's not three separate data points. That's one student in crisis.

### 3. Acts

Drafts the message. Segments the audience. Suggests the follow-up. The AI has already done the thinking — the pastor just needs to care.

**The 8+ data signals SheepDoggo synthesizes:**

| Signal                | What It Captures                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Check-ins             | Attendance patterns, belonging spectrum       |
| SMS Conversations     | Two-way texts, response patterns, sentiment   |
| Prayer Data           | Prayer requests, who prayed for whom, themes  |
| Devotional Engagement | Opened, reflected, prayed, journaled          |
| Group Participation   | Memberships, roles, social connectedness      |
| Engagement Scoring    | Points, streaks, achievements, rank           |
| Survey/Profile Data   | Spiritual maturity, interests, family context |
| Calendar/Events       | Upcoming events, registration, deadlines      |
| Parent Interactions   | Family communication as pastoral signal       |

Planning Center is a filing cabinet. SheepDoggo is the wise intern who read every file and is now saying: _"Hey, you should call Sarah today — here's why."_

## The Home Screen IS the Co-Pilot

When you open SheepDoggo, you don't see a dashboard. You see your flock — already organized into attention buckets. Already prioritized. Already actionable.

**What the pastor sees:**

- **"3 students need you today"** — A curated action list. Each card shows who, why, and a pre-drafted message. Review, tweak, send. One click.
- **Belonging Spectrum** — Your entire ministry organized by connection level: Ultra-Core, Core, Connected, On the Fringe, Missing. Tap any tier to see names and take action.
- **Prayer Wall** — What your students are praying about right now. The co-pilot connects prayer themes to outreach suggestions.
- **Recent Wins** — "You reached out to 5 students this week." Encouragement, not metrics.

The AI considered check-ins, prayer requests, text history, devotional engagement, and belonging status to prioritize these actions. The pastor didn't have to think about any of that.

**Total time: 10 minutes. Students reached: 15. Prayers offered: 15. Hours saved: 3.**

The goal: a pastor opens SheepDoggo for 30 seconds, knows exactly who to reach out to, and gets on with their day.

## Who We Build For

### The Primary User: The Pastor / Ministry Leader

> _"Pastors are usually not technical or business savvy or product managers. The idea of digital engagement goes over their heads. But they understand it can be very useful if done right."_

**What they're good at:**

- Caring for people
- Having conversations
- Praying with and for their flock
- Noticing when someone seems off
- Building relationships over time

**What they struggle with:**

- Remembering who they haven't seen lately
- Tracking attendance mentally across dozens of people
- Using technology that feels corporate or clinical
- Understanding analytics dashboards and metrics
- Finding time to be proactive when reactive needs dominate

**What they wish they had:**
A single place that tells them who needs them, what to say, and a prayer to ground the conversation. Not another tool to learn. Not another dashboard to check. A co-pilot that already did the homework and is ready to brief them.

## Design Principles

### 1. Prayer-First

- **AI insights include prayer prompts** — When we suggest "Reach out to Sarah who hasn't been here in 3 weeks", we also provide: _"Lord, give me the right words for Sarah. Help her know she's seen and loved..."_
- **Before action, invite reflection** — Before a leader texts or calls, a gentle prompt: "Take a moment to pray for this conversation"
- **Celebrate spiritual moments** — Not just attendance stats, but "3 students mentioned faith conversations this month"

### 2. Co-Pilot, Not Dashboard

- **Actionable, not informational** — Every screen answers "what should I do?" not "what happened?"
- **Pre-drafted everything** — Messages, outreach plans, follow-up reminders. The pastor reviews and sends. We do the work.
- **Adapts without configuration** — No workflow builders, no automation rules, no filters to learn. The AI adapts as things change.

> _"I don't want them to feel like they need to administer a gazillion workflows. We need to own the workflow management for them."_

### 3. Beautiful & Peaceful

- **Breathing room** — Generous whitespace, not cramped or cluttered
- **Calm colors** — Soft gradients, natural tones, nothing harsh or jarring
- **Smooth animations** — Gentle transitions that feel alive but not distracting
- **Visual hierarchy** — Clear focus on what matters most right now

### 4. Encouraging Language

_Clinical vs. Caring:_

| Avoid                        | Use Instead                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "0 check-ins this week"      | "No one's checked in yet — your students are waiting!"        |
| "Task failed"                | "Let's try that again"                                        |
| "3 students at risk"         | "3 students could use some extra love this week"              |
| "Data imported successfully" | "Welcome to your new roster! Ready to start caring for them?" |

_Dashboard vs. Pastoral:_

| Don't Say              | Say Instead                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| "Engagement metrics"   | "Who you've connected with"      |
| "At-risk members"      | "People who could use some love" |
| "Retention rate"       | "Students who keep coming back"  |
| "KPIs"                 | (just don't)                     |
| "Data-driven insights" | "Here's who might need you"      |
| "Funnel"               | (never)                          |

### 5. Fun & Enjoyable

- **Gamification with purpose** — The JRPG check-in isn't just fun, it makes students _want_ to come back
- **Micro-interactions** — Buttons that respond, cards that lift on hover, confetti on milestones
- **Personality** — The app has a voice that's warm, supportive, and occasionally playful

### 6. Divinely Inspired Details

- **Scripture woven in** — Not preachy, but present. A relevant verse in the footer, an encouraging Psalm on the empty state
- **Seasonal awareness** — Acknowledgment of church calendar, holidays, back-to-school
- **Named for faithfulness** — "SheepDoggo" evokes watchfulness, loyalty, and tireless care for the flock

---

## Copy Guidelines

- Use "we" and "you" — the app is a partner, not a tool
- Acknowledge the hard work of ministry ("We know you're pouring your heart out")
- Celebrate progress, however small
- Never guilt or shame for metrics
- Be specific in encouragement ("You reached out to 5 students this week" > "Good job")

---

## What We Are NOT

- **Not a ChMS replacement** — We integrate with Planning Center, Rock RMS, and CCB. They keep the church records. We make them actionable.
- **Not a general church platform** — Purpose-built for relational ministry. Youth groups, college ministries, small groups. Not Sunday morning production.
- **Not an automation platform** — AI drafts, humans approve. Every message a student receives was reviewed by a real human who cares about them.
- **Not surveillance** — Engagement tracking enables care, not judgment. We never surface data to shame. Every metric exists to help a pastor love better.
