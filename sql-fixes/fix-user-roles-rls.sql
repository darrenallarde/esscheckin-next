-- Fix user_roles RLS policies to allow authenticated users to read their own roles
-- This fixes the 406 error when querying user_roles

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own roles" ON public.user_roles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all roles" ON public.user_roles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update roles" ON public.user_roles;

-- Create new policies with authenticated check
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own roles"
ON public.user_roles
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all roles"
ON public.user_roles
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage roles"
ON public.user_roles
FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT SELECT ON public.user_roles TO authenticated;
