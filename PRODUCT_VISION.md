# Seedling Insights: Product Vision

**Platform**: Seedling Insights
**Tagline**: *Cultivating care, one connection at a time*
**Core Purpose**: Prayer-driven spiritual formation - AI surfaces who needs care, with prayer prompts to guide leaders
**Business Model**: SaaS subscription for churches
**Onboarding**: White-glove setup (team creates org, invites customer as owner)

---

## The Soul of the App

> *"The tool should never feel stale. It should feel fun. Useful. Enjoyable to use. Easy. Quite literally divinely inspired."*

This isn't just check-in software. It's a **spiritual formation tool** that helps ministry leaders see their people the way God sees them - with intention, care, and purpose. Every feature, every interaction, every piece of copy should reflect this.

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Prayer-First
- **AI insights include prayer prompts** - When we suggest "Reach out to Sarah who hasn't been here in 3 weeks", we also provide: *"Lord, give me the right words for Sarah. Help her know she's seen and loved..."*
- **Before action, invite reflection** - Before a leader texts or calls, a gentle prompt: "Take a moment to pray for this conversation"
- **Celebrate spiritual moments** - Not just attendance stats, but "3 students mentioned faith conversations this month"

### 2. Never Stale, Always Fresh
- **Dynamic content** - Rotating scripture verses, fresh encouragements, seasonal awareness
- **Surprise and delight** - Unexpected celebrations: "You've connected with every new student this month!"
- **Thoughtful defaults** - Smart suggestions that make leaders feel supported, not overwhelmed

### 3. Beautiful & Peaceful
- **Breathing room** - Generous whitespace, not cramped or cluttered
- **Calm colors** - Soft gradients, natural tones, nothing harsh or jarring
- **Smooth animations** - Gentle transitions that feel alive but not distracting
- **Visual hierarchy** - Clear focus on what matters most right now

### 4. Encouraging Language
*Clinical vs. Caring:*
| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "0 check-ins this week" | "No one's checked in yet - your students are waiting!" |
| "Task failed" | "Let's try that again" |
| "3 students at risk" | "3 students could use some extra love this week" |
| "Data imported successfully" | "Welcome to your new roster! Ready to start caring for them?" |

### 5. Fun & Enjoyable
- **Gamification with purpose** - The JRPG check-in isn't just fun, it makes students *want* to come back
- **Micro-interactions** - Buttons that respond, cards that lift on hover, confetti on milestones
- **Personality** - The app has a voice that's warm, supportive, and occasionally playful

### 6. Divinely Inspired Details
- **Scripture woven in** - Not preachy, but present. A relevant verse in the footer, an encouraging Psalm on the empty state
- **Seasonal awareness** - Acknowledgment of church calendar, holidays, back-to-school, etc.
- **Named for growth** - "Seedling" evokes nurturing, patience, faith that something small will grow

---

## Copy Guidelines

- Use "we" and "you" - the app is a partner, not a tool
- Acknowledge the hard work of ministry ("We know you're pouring your heart out")
- Celebrate progress, however small
- Never guilt or shame for metrics
- Be specific in encouragement ("You reached out to 5 students this week" > "Good job")

---

## Who We're Building For

### The Primary User: The Pastor/Ministry Leader

> *"Pastors are usually not technical or business savvy or product managers. The idea of digital engagement goes over their heads. But they understand it can be very useful if done right."*

**What they're good at:**
- Caring for people
- Having conversations
- Praying with and for their flock
- Noticing when someone seems off
- Building relationships over time

**What they struggle with:**
- Remembering who they haven't seen lately
- Tracking attendance mentally across dozens of people
- Using technology that feels corporate or clinical
- Understanding analytics dashboards and metrics
- Finding time to be proactive when reactive needs dominate

---

## Dashboard Philosophy: "Who Needs Me Today?"

The dashboard should NOT feel like:
- A business analytics platform
- A CRM with pipelines and funnels
- A project management tool
- Something that requires training to understand

The dashboard SHOULD feel like:
- A wise friend saying "Hey, here's who could use a call today"
- A simple list of people to pray for
- A celebration of the connections already made
- An assistant that remembers what you forget

**Avoid this language:**
| Don't Say | Say Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Engagement metrics" | "Who you've connected with" |
| "At-risk members" | "People who could use some love" |
| "Retention rate" | "Students who keep coming back" |
| "KPIs" | (just don't) |
| "Data-driven insights" | "Here's who might need you" |
| "Funnel" | (never) |

### The Dashboard Hierarchy

**1. TODAY'S PRIORITY (top, largest)**
- 3-5 people who need attention right now
- Prayer prompt included
- One-click to text/call
- Why they're surfaced (in human terms): "Sarah hasn't been here in 3 weeks"

**2. RECENT WINS (celebrate)**
- "You reached out to Marcus yesterday!"
- "4 new students joined this month"
- Quick encouragements, not stats

**3. SIMPLE OVERVIEW (not charts)**
- This week: 12 check-ins
- Last week: 15 check-ins
- "About the same - steady is good!"

**4. QUICK ACTIONS**
- "Check in a student"
- "Add someone new"
- "See everyone" (full list)

The goal: **A pastor should be able to open this for 30 seconds, know who to reach out to, and get on with their day.**

## AI-First Pastoral Assistant

> *"I don't want them to feel like they need to administer a gazillion workflows. We need to own the workflow management for them."*

### Philosophy: We Do The Work

**The Problem with Planning Center / Rock RMS:**
> *"Pastors spend all this time creating crazy workflows that are built on glass... they break so easily and only work for a season. There's no flexibility. They require deep technical expertise."*

A typical Rock RMS workflow:
```
Member joins → Send welcome email → Send leader info email → END
```
Basic. Transactional. Brittle. Required hours to set up.

**The Seedling Difference:**

We don't give them a workflow builder. **We build the workflows FOR them.**

Pastors should NOT:
- Configure automation rules
- Build follow-up sequences
- Set up reminder workflows
- Learn how to use filters and reports
- Manage a task queue
- Become a "Rock RMS expert"

Seedling Insights SHOULD:
- Just work out of the box
- Handle all the automation invisibly
- Adapt as things change (no brittle "if-then" rules)
- Feel magical, not technical
- Let pastors be pastors

---

## From Transactional to Transformational

**Old Way (Planning Center/Rock):**
```
New member joins group
  ↓
Send generic welcome email
  ↓
Send leader notification
  ↓
END (and hope someone follows up manually)
```

**Seedling Way:**
```
New member joins group
  ↓
CELEBRATE - Personal welcome with their name, group info, what to expect
  ↓
Leader gets notified with CONTEXT:
  "Marcus just joined your group! Here's what we know:
   - He's new to the church (joined 2 weeks ago)
   - He's in 8th grade
   - He came with his friend Jake

   Suggested first message: 'Hey Marcus! So glad you're
   joining us. Jake mentioned you're into basketball -
   we should talk about that!'"
  ↓
3 days later: "How's Marcus settling in? Quick check-in?"
  ↓
Week 2: Prompt leader - "Ask Marcus: How can I pray for you?"
  ↓
Week 4: "Marcus has been consistent! Time to celebrate him?"
  ↓
ONGOING: AI watches for changes, surfaces insights
```

---

## Guest Experience Reimagined

**Current Reality (Manual & Basic):**
```
New guest visits church
  ↓
Supposed to get: welcome email, text from pastor,
  Starbucks card, newcomer course invite
  ↓
Reality: Someone has to remember to do each thing
  Half the time it doesn't happen
  No personalization
  Feels like a funnel, not a welcome
```

**Seedling Way:**
```
New guest visits church
  ↓
IMMEDIATELY:
  - Warm text from "the church" (auto, but personal tone):
    "So glad you joined us today! We'd love to get to know you better."

SAME DAY:
  - Pastor gets a card: "New guest: Sarah Williams, came with the Johnsons"
  - One-tap to send personal video message or text

DAY 2:
  - Gift card sent automatically (digital, instant)
  - "Thanks for visiting! Coffee's on us"

DAY 3-7:
  - Invite to newcomers gathering
  - But SMART: "Sarah, we noticed you came with the Johnsons -
    they're coming to our newcomer lunch. Want to join them?"

WEEK 2:
  - If they came back: "Sarah came again! She's connecting."
  - If they didn't: Surface to pastor with suggested outreach

ONGOING:
  - AI tracks their journey
  - Surfaces when they need attention
  - Celebrates when they're thriving
```

The difference: **No pastor had to build this. It just works. And it adapts.**

## Three AI Superpowers

### 1. Automated Care Workflows (We Own It)
The system automatically handles:

**Auto Follow-ups:**
- Student misses 2 weeks → System drafts a text for leader to approve/send
- New student's 3rd visit → Celebration text auto-suggested
- Birthday coming up → Reminder surfaces with suggested message

**Smart Reminders:**
- "You said you'd follow up with Marcus - it's been 3 days"
- "Sarah's parents asked about volunteer opportunities - here's a reminder"

**Proactive Outreach:**
- Weekly digest: "Here are 5 people who could use connection this week"
- Seasonal: "School starts next week - here are students entering new grades"

**The pastor's only job:** Approve/personalize the message and hit send. Or just let it go automatically if they trust it.

### 2. Natural Language Analytics (Just Ask)

Instead of clicking through filters and dashboards:

```
Pastor types: "Show me all 8th graders who joined in the last 2 months"

Seedling responds:
"Found 7 students:
- Marcus Johnson (joined Oct 15)
- Sarah Williams (joined Nov 2)
- ...

Recommendation: These are your newest 8th graders -
they're still figuring out if they belong. Consider having
a leader personally check in with each one this week."
```

More examples:
- "Who hasn't been here in 3 weeks?"
- "Which students have parents we haven't contacted?"
- "Show me students who came every week last month"
- "Who are my most consistent 6th graders?"

The AI:
1. Understands the question
2. Queries the data
3. Returns human-readable results
4. **Adds a recommendation** for what to do about it

### 3. Proactive Recommendations with Action

Not just "here's who needs attention" but:

```
"Sarah hasn't been here in 3 weeks.

Here's what we suggest:
1. Text her (draft ready): 'Hey Sarah! We've missed seeing you...'
2. Or call - here's her number: (555) 123-4567
3. Reach out to her parents: Mom's number is...

Prayer for Sarah: 'Lord, wherever Sarah is right now,
let her know she's loved and missed...'

[Send Text] [Mark as Contacted] [Dismiss]"
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current - COMPLETED)
- Basic recommendations with prayer prompts
- Manual outreach (leader clicks to text/call)
- Simple dashboard with "who needs attention"
- Multi-org SaaS architecture
- Path-based org routing
- CSV import

### Phase 2 (Near Future)
- Natural language query: "Ask Seedling" input box
- AI interprets and returns results + recommendation
- Draft messages for approval

### Phase 3 (Future)
- Automated workflows (auto-send after approval threshold)
- Smart scheduling (best time to reach out)
- Multi-channel (text, email, Instagram DM suggestions)
- Learning from what works (which outreach gets responses)

---

## What's Deferred (Future Phases)

- [ ] Self-service org signup
- [ ] Ministry type selection (student vs small group)
- [ ] Small group features (devotionals, prayer campaigns, engagement tracking)
- [ ] Billing/subscription management
- [ ] Help center / docs
- [ ] Planning Center import integration
- [ ] Enhanced prayer features (team prayer lists, prayer history)

---

## AI Recommendations Enhancement

Since AI pastoral insights are our core differentiator, ensure recommendations include:

```typescript
interface PastoralRecommendation {
  // Existing
  studentId: string;
  keyInsight: string;           // "Sarah hasn't been here in 3 weeks"
  actionBullets: string[];      // Specific outreach suggestions
  contextParagraph: string;     // Why this matters

  // Prayer integration
  prayerPrompt?: string;        // "Lord, help Sarah feel seen..."
  scriptureEncouragement?: string; // "Be strong and courageous - Joshua 1:9"
}
```

---

## Admin Org Creation Flow

When you (as super admin) create a new organization:

**Step 1: Create Organization**
- `/admin/organizations/new` or direct database insert initially
- Fields: slug, display_name, theme_id, checkin_style

**Step 2: Configure via Settings**
- Navigate to `/{org-slug}/settings/organization`
- Theme picker with live preview
- Display name with preview of how it appears
- Check-in style selector (gamified/standard/minimal)

**Step 3: Invite Owner**
- Settings → Team → Invite
- Enter customer's email as "owner" role

**Step 4: Import Roster**
- Settings → Import
- Upload CSV, map columns, preview, import
- AI recommendations auto-generate

**Result**: Customer gets invite email → logs in → sees their fully-configured org
